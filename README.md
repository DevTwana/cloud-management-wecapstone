# Technologies I used in this project

## [React Library](https://reactjs.org/)

## [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
I used React Router for routing between pages, this way you can jump from one page to another without the need to refresh the page, so the tab doesn't refresh at all.

## [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)
React icons consists of many icon libraries including _font awsome_, _bootstrap_ and many more.

## [Tailwindcss] (https://tailwindcss.com/)
I used this for the purpose of productivity, so instead of writing all the css youself, you can just add classes.

## [Redux ToolKit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development

## [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.dev/)(https://heroicons.com/)
Beautiful hand-crafted SVG icons, by the makers of Tailwind CSS.
